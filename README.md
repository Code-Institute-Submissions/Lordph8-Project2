# MileStone Project 2
I am a casual Pen and Paper RPG player (D&D, Shadowrun etc) and in those games you roll dice to dictate whether your actions are successful, and to calculate effects like damage. Sometimes there are quite a lot of dice involved, and a quick roller and calculator is useful.
## UX
Something Simple and effective. Input (number of dice, type of dice, bonus, and options), output which shows images of the dice and the totals in a nice clean UI
Link to wireframes
## Features
Javascript random number generator that produces outputs based on the type of dice selected. Utilizing that number with the type of dice and JQuery I populate the website with images for each dice result.
I have build in 3 special Options:
 
Get Max Roll
Gets the best roll result from the selected amount of dice plus bonus.
 
Get Min Roll
Gets the worst roll result from the selected amount of dice plus bonus.
 
Dice Explosion!
If you roll the maximum possible roll on a dice, it will add another dice to the roll. For example If you roll 10 D6s, and 2 of them roll 6, you will add 2 more dice. This continues until the dice stops rolling a 6.

Although it has an open license my javascript is unique and utilizes none of GreenImps work.
